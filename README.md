# OpusFilter

OpusFilter is a tool for filtering and combining parallel corpora. It
uses the OpusTools library (Aulamo et al., 2020) to download data from
the OPUS corpus collection (Tiedemann, 2012), but can be used with any
corpora in raw text format.

This is a fork from [Helsinki-NLP/OpusFilter](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OpusFilter).
We seeks to aggressively refactor the original project.

Features:

* Corpus preprocessing pipelines configured with [YAML](https://yaml.org/)
* Simple downloading of parallel corpora from [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) with [OpusTools](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OpusTools)
* Implementations for many common text file operations on parallel files
* Memory-efficient processing of large files
* Implemented filters based e.g. on language identification, word aligment, n-gram language models, and multilingual sentence embeddings
* Extendable with your own filters written in Python

OpusFilter has been presented in [ACL 2020 system demonstrations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.20).

See the [documentation](https://nmt-hub.github.io/filter/) for more information and examples.

A changelog is available in [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md).
